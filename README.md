# COVID19-Vaccine-HealthCenter
Final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures class

On this final class project was proposed to be developed a covid-19 vaccine management system in C programming language.
The main goals for the project were:
  - State the total vaccines administrated.
  - State the average age of vaccinated people.
  - Quantity of people vaccinated by vaccine type.
  - On the user perspective, the program should permit:
    - Insert, edit and inactivate vaccines.
    - Insert, edit and inactivate vaccination centers.
    - Insert, edit and remove vaccinated users.
    - List all vaccines alphabetically.
    - List users by vaccine.
    - List users by vaccination center.
    - List next dosage date for a user.
    - List all users that should be vaccinated (2nd shot) on a certain day.
  - All data must be persisted on files.
